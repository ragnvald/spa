The purpose of this script (islands_proliferation_analysis.py) is to perform an analysis to understand the pattern of species proliferation in the archipelagio of Norway. The result of the script is eradication zones for land animals - in this case american mink.

The script is neutral with regards to geography and species. It could therefore be used other places for other species.

The Species Proliferation Analysis (SPA) will help you do the desktop part of the job. The fieldwork is however still there to be done. As well as the political side of things. 

The following blog posting will go in depth on this issue:
